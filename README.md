# language-graphql-lb package

This gramar package provides syntax highlighting for [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) files with a file extension of `.graphql` and `.gql`. It is the same grammar as used by the [language-babel](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel) package which highlights graphql code within JavaScipt, and in particular template literals.
